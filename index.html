<a id="a-more-personalized-shopping-experience" class="anchor" href="#a-more-personalized-shopping-experience" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A more personalized shopping experience</h3>

<p>When you use the Shopping Preferences Chrome extension, it shares your shopping preferences with online retailers, who can use that information to personalize your experience.</p>

<h3>
<a id="its-all-under-your-control" class="anchor" href="#its-all-under-your-control" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>It's all under your control</h3>

<p>You get to choose what gets shared with online retailers.  Don't feel comfortable revealing demographic information?  That's OK.  You can reveal as much or as little about yourself as you want.</p>

<h3>
<a id="not-stored-in-the-cloud" class="anchor" href="#not-stored-in-the-cloud" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Not stored in the cloud</h3>

<p>Concerned about privacy?  The shopping preferences you provide are stored locally in your web browser, not off in the cloud.  (Note that Chrome does offer users the ability to sync this data across devices.)</p>
