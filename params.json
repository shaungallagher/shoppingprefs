Don't feel comfortable revealing demographic information?  That's OK.  You can reveal as much or as little about yourself as you want.\r\n\r\n### Not stored in the cloud\r\nConcerned about privacy?  The shopping preferences you provide are stored locally in your web browser, not off in the cloud.  (Note that Chrome does offer users the ability to sync this data across devices.)",
